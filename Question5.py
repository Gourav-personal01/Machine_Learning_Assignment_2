# Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models.
# How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?

# Answer - 
# Detecting Overfitting:
# 1. Cross-Validation
# 2. Holdout Validation

# Detecting Underfitting: 
# 1. Validation Performance
# 2. Visual Inspection

# overfitting is often characterized by a model that performs well on training data but poorly on validation or test data, 
# while underfitting is characterized by a model that performs poorly on both training and validation data.
